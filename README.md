============

At Hack The North 2014 we made a real life inventory system. Using the estimote beacons (http://estimote.com/) we would track the proximity of an object to the user's phone, then the user could check his 'inventory' through a pebble smartwatch. If a beacon was outside of the detection range of the phone, then the user would be notified that he dropped an item.
